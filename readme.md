# AVA Format
## A Set of Extensions for the STF Format to Represent VR & V-Tubing Avatars

## **This is a proof of concept!**

A set of hot-loadable extensions for the [STF format](https://github.com/emperorofmars/stf-unity) in Unity to represent the various components that make up Avatars for Social-VR and V-Tubing applications and convert them into specific application formats. (VRChat, VRM and ChilloutVR)

## Setup
- This will not work standalone, please import the STF Unity implementation first: [https://github.com/emperorofmars/stf-unity](https://github.com/emperorofmars/stf-unity)
- Download or clone this repository and copy the entire folder into your Unity projects 'Assets' folder.
- Ensure that you have either a current VRChat, ChilloutVR SDK or the UniVRM SDK in the version 0.89.0 (The same version that is required for the VSeeFace SDK).
- If you have an STF file with AVA components correctly set up, you can just import it. Its UI will give you the option to spawn a ready to upload VRChat, ChilloutVR or VRM avatar. It will give you the option to spawn it only if you have the appropriate SDK included.

---

Most components are only partly implemented without too much thought.

This exists only to show that this is possible and realistic.
