# AVA Format
## A Set of Extensions for the STF Format to Represent VR & V-Tubing Avatars

## **This is a proof of concept!**

A set of hot-loadable extensions for the [STF format](https://github.com/emperorofmars/stf-unity) in Unity to represent the various components that make up Avatars for Social-VR and V-Tubing applications and convert them into specific application formats. (VRChat, VRM and ChilloutVR)

## Setup
- This will not work standalone, please setup the STF Unity implementation first: [https://github.com/emperorofmars/stf-unity](https://github.com/emperorofmars/stf-unity)
- Download or clone this repository and copy the entire folder into your Unity projects 'Assets' folder.
- Ensure that you have either a current VRChat, ChilloutVR SDK or the UniVRM SDK in the version 0.89.0 (The same version that is required for the VSeeFace SDK).
- If you have an STF file with AVA components correctly set up, you can just import it. Its UI will give you the option to spawn a ready to upload VRChat, ChilloutVR or VRM avatar. It will give you the option to spawn it only if you have the appropriate SDK included.

Most components are only partly implemented without too much thought.

This exists only to show that this is possible and realistic.
