# AVA Format
## A Set of Extensions for the STF Format to Represent VR & V-Tubing Avatars

**This is a proof of concept!**

This is a set of hot-loadable extensions for the STF format in Unity.

It will not work standalone, please import the STF Unity implementation first: [https://github.com/emperorofmars/stf-unity](https://github.com/emperorofmars/stf-unity)

---

Most components are only partly implemented without too much thought.

This exists to show that this is possible and realistic.
